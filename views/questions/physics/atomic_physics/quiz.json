        "It occurs in nuclear power stations.",
        "It involves a larger nucleus decaying into two (or more) smaller nuclides.",

      "scheme": 3,
      "explanation": "The correct answer is: Light nuclei fuse together, releasing energy in the process. Nuclear fusion is a reaction that occurs in the Sun. The Sun releases energy by fusing hydrogen atoms together and helium atoms together."
