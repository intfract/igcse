  <h2 class="hidden offset">Principles of Electrolysis</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">Electrolysis is the breakdown of an <strong>ionic compound</strong> by passing electricity through it.</p>

    <div class="note">
      The roots, "electro" and "lysis" mean electricity and disintegration respectively.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="hidden offset">There are certain conditions for electrolysis to work properly.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>Covalent compounds are poor conductors of electricity and are not suitable for electrolysis</li>
    <li>
      Ions need to be mobile
      <ul>
        <li>Ionic compounds in a solid state are poor conductors of electricity because their ions are trapped in a lattice structure</li>
        <li><strong>Molten</strong> ionic compounds split when <a href="/courses/physics/electromagnetism" target="_blank">direct current</a> is passed.</li>
        <li><strong>Aqueous</strong> solutions of ionic compounds can conduct electricity</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    <div class="note">
      It should be common knowledge that opposite charges attract and like charges repel. Electrons are negatively charged which means they repel other negatively charged particles.
    </div>
  </div>
  <p class="hidden offset">There are 6 main ideas involved in electrolysis.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      <strong>Anion</strong>: a negatively charged ion that is a nonmetal
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cation</strong>: a positively charged ion that is usually a metal (hydrogen is the exception)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Electrode</strong>: a rod made out of an <strong>inert</strong> (unreactive) material such as graphite (carbon) or platinum that is connected to a DC power supply
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Anode</strong>: the positively charged electrode that attracts negatively charged <strong>anions</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Cathode</strong>: the negatively charged electrode that attracts positively charged <strong>cations</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Electrolyte</strong>: the molten ionic compound or aqueous solution that is being electrolysed
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Redox Reactions</strong>: the exchange of electrons that occur at each electrode
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduction</strong>: is the gain of electrons and happens at the cathode</li>
        <li><strong>Oxidation</strong>: is the loss of electrons and happens at the anode</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Ionic Half Equations</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Half equations are used to represent the reactions that take place at each electrode. Half equations only involve ions and electrons. Electrons are represented by \( e^{-} \) in half equations due to their negative charge.</p>
  <p class="katex-display">
    \( Al^{3+} + 3e^{-} → Al \)
  </p>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Molten Lead Bromide</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">The electrolysis of molten lead(II) bromide is a classic example. Lead(II) bromide is an ionic compound made up of 1 lead ion and 2 bromide ions.</p>

  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Anode and Cathode Reactions</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">The product at the anode is bromine gas while the product at the cathode is lead.</p>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p class="hidden offset">Lead is reduced at the negatively charged cathode.</p>
      <p class="katex-display">
        \( Pb^{2+} + 2e^{-} → Pb \)
      </p>

    <div class="column">
      <p class="hidden offset">Chlorine is oxidised at the positively charged anode.</p>
      <p class="katex-display">
        \( 2Br^{-} - 2e^{-} → Br_{2} \)
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Aqueous Sodium Chloride</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">The electrolysis of aqueous solutions is more complex because water is involved. Water has hydrogen ions \( H^{+} \) and hydroxide \( OH^{-} \) ions.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Electrode Rules</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Only one type of ion can be discharged at each electrode. The cathode has to choose between hydrogen ions and sodium ions while the anode has to choose between hydroxide ions and chloride ions.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      The least reactive cation will be discharged at the cathode unless it is really unreactive like platinum and graphite
      <ul>
        <li>Copper</li>
        <li>Hydrogen</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
        <li>Zinc</li>
        <li>Carbon</li>
        <li>Aluminium</li>
        <li><strong>Group 2</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Group 1</strong></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      The anion discharged at the anode depends on the concentration of an aqueous solution
      <ul class="hidden offset">
        <li>The halide ions will always get discharged in a concentrated solution</li>
        <li>The hydroxide ions will sometimes get discharged in a dilute solution</li>
        <li>The sulphate and nitrate ions will never get discharged</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Molten Aluminium Oxide and Cryolite</h2>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Cryolite</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Aluminium oxide is mixed with <strong>cryolite</strong> to reduce its melting point. Reducing the melting point is important because it means less thermal energy is required to melt aluminium oxide.</p>
