  <h2 class="hidden offset">Organisms</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">There are 7 characteristics of living organisms. Cells are responsible for carrying out these processes.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>Movement</li>
    <li>Respiration</li>
    <li>Sensitivity</li>
    <li>Growth</li>
    <li>Reproduction</li>
    <li>Excretion</li>
    <li>Nutrition</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Movement</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is an action by an organism or a part of an organism that causes a change in position or place.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Respiration</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is the breakdown of nutrient molecules to <strong>release energy</strong> for metabolism.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="note">
      Respiration is <strong>not</strong> breathing. Mechanical ventilation refers to the movement of the respiratory system while breathing.
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Sensitivity</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is the ability to detect changes or stimuli in the environment and respond appropriately. Neurons are involved in the process.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Growth</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is a permanent increase in size or dry mass by an increase in cell number or size.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Reproduction</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is the process of producing new offspring of the same kind of organism. There are two types.</p>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>Sexual (Genetically Different Offspring)</li>
    <li>Asexual (Genetically Identical Offspring)</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Excretion</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is the process of removing waste products of metabolism and toxic material.</p>
  <div class="callout warning hidden small">
    <div class="emoji-container">
      ⚠
    </div>
    <div class="note">
      Excretion is <strong>not</strong> egestion. Egestion is the removal of undigested food particles. Excretion includes peeing and sweating.
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Nutrition</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">This is the intake of food for the absorption of nutrients. The digestive system is involved in this process.</p>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Cell Structure</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">Plant cells and animal cells have distinct features that make them distinguishable.</p>
  <div class="diagram hidden">

    <div class="column">
      <h3 class="hidden offset">Plant Cell</h3>
      <p class="hidden offset">Plant cells have 3 organelles that animal cells lack.</p>
      <ul class="hidden offset">
        <li>Cell Wall</li>
        <li>Chloroplast</li>
        <li>Vacuole (Large)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="hidden offset">The cell wall is <strong>fully permeable</strong> unlike the cell membrane which is <strong>partially permeable</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <h3 class="hidden offset">Animal Cell</h3>
    <p class="hidden offset">Rarely, some animal cells have small vacuoles. However, the main difference is that animal cells have an irregular shape due to the lack of a cell wall.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Cell Processes</h2>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Diffusion</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Diffusion is the <strong>movement of particles</strong> from a region of <strong>high to low concentration</strong> due to Brownian motion or the random movement of particles. Diffusion is a <strong>passive</strong> process.</p>
  <p class="hidden offset">Some factors <strong>increase the rate of diffusion</strong> and some factors <strong>decrease the rate of diffusion</strong>.</p>
  <div class="columns">
    <ul class="hidden offset plus">
      <li>Temperature</li>
      <li>Concentration Gradient</li>
      <li>Surface Area</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="hidden offset minus">
      <li>Diffusion Distance</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Osmosis</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of high to low water potential through a partially permeable membrane. Osmosis is a <strong>passive</strong> process.</p>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Hypertonic and Hypotonic Solutions</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">A hypertonic solution has a high concentration and low water potential. A hypotonic solution has a low concentration and high water potential. Concentration is a measure of how much of a substance is dissolved in water in the context of osmosis. The terms hypertonic and hyoptonic are relative to the cell.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Hypertonic Solution</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Water leaves the plant or animal cell via osmosis because the water potential inside the cell is greater than the water potential of the solution.</p>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p class="hidden offset"><strong>Plasmolysis</strong> occurs in plant cells when a large amount of water has left the cytoplasm. This loss of water causes the cytoplasm to shrink and the cell membrane to peel away from the cell wall.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p class="hidden offset"><strong>Crenation</strong> occurs in animal cells. The loss of water causes the animal cell to shrink and become spiky. This is largely because the surface area of the cell remains constant while the volume decreases.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Hypotonic Solution</h3>
  <p class="hidden offset">Water enters the plant or animal cell via osmosis because the water potentian inside the cell is less than the water potential of the solution.</p>
  <div class="columns">
    <div class="column">
      <p class="hidden offset"><strong>Turgidity</strong> is a state achieved by plant cells that are full with water. Something is turgid when it is stiff. No reference was intended. Plant cells do not burst because they have a strong cellulose cell wall.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p class="hidden offset"><strong>Lysis</strong> is the process of an animal cell getting nuked due to excessive swelling. The animal cell bursts when the water pressure inside the cell is too high.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 class="hidden offset">Cell Specialisation</h2>
  <p class="hidden offset">Some cells may have a greater or fewer number of cell organelles depending on their role in the organism. For example, not all plant cells will have chloroplasts.</p>
  <p class="hidden offset">Cells may develop adaptations.</p>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Ciliated Cells</h3>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      <strong>Cilia</strong>: pushing mucus
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Root Hair Cells</h3>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      <strong>Large Surface Area</strong>: absorption of water and mineral ions
    </li>
    <li><strong>Large Vacuole</strong>: storage of water</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Palisade Mesophyll Cells</h3>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      <strong>Many Chloroplasts</strong>: photosynthesis
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Red Blood Cells</h3>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      <strong>Haemoglobin</strong>: transport of oxygen
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="hidden offset">Sperm and Egg Cells</h3>
  <ul class="hidden offset">
    <li>
      <strong>Flagellum</strong>: swimming (sperm)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Jelly Coating</strong>: protection (egg)
    </li>
  </ul>
